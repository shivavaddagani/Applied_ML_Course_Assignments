# Applied ML Online Course <br>
When my project in CSIR-IICT was completed in July 2020, I started to learn python basics(sole motivation is to get into the field of Data Science).<br> 
After enquiring many online courses finally I decided to take up this course, pursuing since December 7 2020. Motivation for choosing this course is because it is self-paced and is in my budget.

# Course structure
1. Course aims to make students to have job ready skills.
2. Course contains recorded videos on python, sql, data cleaning, modeling, hyperparameter tuning, deep learning and real world case studies.
3. Most important part is the Assignments structure. Assignments are structured in such a way that once we solve those we get a lot of understanding on how each algorithm works.
